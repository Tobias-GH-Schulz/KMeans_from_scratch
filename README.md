# KMeans from Scratch (possibly upload a picture here maybe)

##Description
We decided to write KMeans from scratch to help us better understand what KMeans essentially does and at the same time improve our understanding of the classes. In the process we learnt how to code in a more pythonic manner, object oriented and came across mutliple hurdles. 
Our KMeans works for multiple dimensions, it is not restricted to a 2D surface. This in turn reduces the amount of time that the user needs to tinker around with KMeans to set it up for Multi-Dimension.
In our KMeans class code we decided to implement a method that would allow a user to create a multi dimensional graph(4D for now, watch the space ;) ). We believe that it should be something that is baked within the class as visualization is an essential asset within the scope of ML. 
We also implemented the elbow method which allows someone using our code to once again access it with ease and have information that just needs a simple look at to determine the optimal k. The plot is easy to read and interpret.
